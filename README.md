# Autoencoder-based Image Compression for Handwritten Digits

Created Autoencoder-based Image Compression: Enhanced efficiency in storing and transmitting handwritten digit images through advanced compression techniques.

* Developed an Autoencoder using the MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset for image reconstruction.
* Utilized a Dense Neural Network Architecture for encoding and decoding image features.
* Applied image visualization, model training, and evaluation techniques for Autoencoders.
